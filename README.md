nix-config
==========

Config files for nix.

Installation
------------

Use the makefile which will install a few apps and then run Ansible to install.

Something like:

```sh
    sudo make ubuntu
    # ...
    # follow makefiles setup instructions
    # ...
    make ansible
```

Makefile helps guide the first few steps.
